# PDF Reader Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

---

## Step 1: Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

*Note: On Windows, activate the environment using:*

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## Step 2: Start the Database

Make sure Docker is installed and running, then execute:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.db.yml up
```

This will start the database service defined in the Docker Compose file.

---

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Add your Large Language Model (LLM) API key and any other necessary variables to the `.env` file.

---

## Step 5: Run the Ingestion Pipeline

```bash
python3 Ingestion.py
```
Injestion Pipeline Activation: This command will ingest your PDF into the vectordb for semantic search.

*Note: Ingestion pipeline should be run only at first time. Make sure your virtual environment is activated and the database is running.*

---

## Step 6: Launch the Streamlit App

```bash
python -m streamlit run queryForm.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the app in your default web browser.

Here you can query the pdf located inside directory

## Additional Tips

- Always activate your virtual environment before running commands.
- To stop the Docker containers, press `Ctrl + C` and then run `docker compose down` if needed.
- Keep your `.env` file secure and do not commit it to version control.

This version improves clarity, fixes typos (e.g., "Injestion.py" â†’ "Ingestion.py"), and standardizes formatting for better readability. Let me know if you want me to add more sections like troubleshooting or project overview!
